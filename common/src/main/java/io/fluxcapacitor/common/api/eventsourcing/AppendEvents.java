 * Command used to append one or more event batches to the event store.

 * Each {@link EventBatch} corresponds to a single aggregate instance and contains a list of serialized events along
 * with metadata such as the aggregate ID and the current sequence number.
 * <p>
 * This command is typically sent by a client when applying updates to aggregates in an event-sourced system. Events in
 * the same batch are stored atomically and will be assigned sequential positions in the event log.
 *
 * <h2>Routing</h2>
 * The command is routed based on the aggregate ID of the first batch. If multiple batches are included, they should
 * ideally refer to the same aggregate or be routed consistently by design.
