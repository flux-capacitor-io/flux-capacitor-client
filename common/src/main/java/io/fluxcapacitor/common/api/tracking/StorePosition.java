/**
 * Command sent to the Flux platform to update the tracked position for a specific consumer and segment range.
 * <p>
 * This is typically used after a {@code Tracker} has successfully processed a
 * {@link io.fluxcapacitor.common.api.tracking.MessageBatch}, allowing the system to record the latest confirmed index.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Important:</strong> The {@code lastIndex} can only move forward. Attempts to store a lower index than
 * currently registered will be ignored. This ensures resilience against out-of-order or stale tracker activity (e.g.
 * due to temporary disconnects), and helps prevent split-brain scenarios.
 * <p>
 * If you need to explicitly lower a segmentâ€™s index (e.g. for replay or recovery purposes), use the
 * {@link io.fluxcapacitor.common.api.tracking.ResetPosition} command instead.
