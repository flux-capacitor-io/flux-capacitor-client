/**
 * Command to forcibly reset the tracked position for a given consumer and message type.
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link StorePosition}, which only allows the tracked index to move forward, this command allows setting a
 * lower {@code lastIndex}, effectively rewinding the consumerâ€™s position.
 * <p>
 * This is a powerful operation primarily intended for administrative or recovery scenarios. Common use cases include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Reprocessing past messages after fixing a bug or applying a new projection</li>
 *   <li>Resetting a consumer to rehydrate state (e.g. reloading an in-memory cache)</li>
 *   <li>Clearing segment state after corruption or unexpected termination</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Preferred Alternatives</h2>
 * For new consumers or reconfigured tracker instances, it is typically preferred to set the initial tracking index
 * via {@code ConsumerConfiguration} or the {@code @Consumer} annotation.
 * These approaches are safer and declarative, and avoid the potential side effects of resetting an active consumer.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong> Improper use may lead to duplicate processing. Ensure that consumers are idempotent or
 * properly deduplicated before issuing a reset.
