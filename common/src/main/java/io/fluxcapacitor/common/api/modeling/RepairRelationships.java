/**
 * Command to repair or re-index the relationships for an existing aggregate.
 * <p>
 * This is particularly useful when an aggregate model evolves â€” for example, when child entity annotations like
 * {@code @Member} are introduced or corrected. It ensures that future commands targeting those entities can still
 * resolve the correct aggregate and maintain event consistency.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: This command is intended for administrative use and is not normally emitted during regular application flows.
