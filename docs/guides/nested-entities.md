## Nested Entities

Flux Capacitor allows aggregates to contain nested entities ‚Äî for example, users with authorizations or orders with line
items. These nested entities can be added, updated, or removed using the same `@Apply` pattern used for root aggregates.

To define a nested structure, annotate the collection or field with `@Member`:

```java

@Aggregate
@Builder(toBuilder = true)
public record UserAccount(@EntityId UserId userId,
                          UserProfile profile,
                          boolean accountClosed) {

    @Member
    List<Authorization> authorizations;
}
```

Child entities must define their own `@EntityId`:

```java

public record Authorization(@EntityId AuthorizationId authorizationId,
                            Grant grant) {
}
```

### Adding a Child Entity

To add a nested entity like `Authorization`, simply return a new instance from the `@Apply` method:

```java

public record AuthorizeUser(AuthorizationId authorizationId,
                            Grant grant) {

    @Apply
    Authorization apply() {
        return new Authorization(authorizationId, grant);
    }
}
```

The `UserAccount` aggregate is automatically updated to include this new child entity.

### Removing a Child Entity

To remove a nested entity, return `null` from the `@Apply` method:

```java

public record RevokeAuthorization(AuthorizationId authorizationId) {

    @AssertLegal
    void assertExists(@Nullable Authorization authorization) {
        if (authorization == null) {
            throw new IllegalCommandException("Authorization not found");
        }
    }

    @Apply
    Authorization apply(Authorization authorization) {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Flux will automatically prune the child entity with the given `authorizationId`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** When a child entity is added, updated, or removed using an `@Apply` method, Flux Capacitor will:
>
> - Automatically **locate the parent aggregate**
> - Apply the update to the child entity
> - And return a **new instance of the parent** (if it's immutable), with the updated child state included
>
> This allows you to use immutable models (e.g. Java records or classes with Lombok‚Äôs `@Value`) without extra
> boilerplate.

### Loading Entities and Aggregates

Flux Capacitor supports a flexible and powerful approach to loading aggregates and their internal entities using
`FluxCapacitor.loadAggregateFor(...)` and `FluxCapacitor.loadEntity(...)`.

---

#### `loadEntity(entityId)`

Use this method to load a specific entity **without needing to know the aggregate root** it belongs to. This allows APIs
to remain focused and concise‚Äîfor example:

```java
public record CompleteTask(TaskId taskId) {
}
```

With Flux Capacitor, you can handle this using:

[//]: # (@formatter:off)
```java
FluxCapacitor.loadEntity(taskId).assertAndApply(new CompleteTask(taskId));
```
[//]: # (@formatter:on)

Even if the `Task` is deeply nested within a `Project` or other parent aggregate, this method works because of the
**entity relationship tracking** automatically maintained by Flux Capacitor.

Additional behavior:

- If **multiple entities** match the given ID, the one with the **most recently added relationship** is used.
- The **entire aggregate** containing the entity is loaded, ensuring consistency.
- The returned `Entity<T>` provides methods like `assertAndApply(...)` or `apply(...)`, and includes a reference to the
  enclosing aggregate root.

> This enables true *location transparency* for commands and queries: you don‚Äôt need to know or pass along the full
> aggregate path.

#### üîÅ Finding All Aggregates for an Entity

In some scenarios, an entity may be **referenced by multiple aggregates**‚Äîfor example, when using shared reference
data (e.g. a `Currency`, `Role`, or `Label`). If such an entity is updated, you might want to update *all* aggregates
that reference it.

To retrieve all aggregates that currently include a given entity ID:

```java
Map<String, Class<?>> aggregates = FluxCapacitor.get()
        .aggregateRepository()
        .getAggregatesFor(myEntityId);
```

This returns a map of aggregate IDs and their types.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** This pattern should only be used if you know the number of associated aggregates will remain small and
> bounded. If many aggregates accumulate over time, this lookup can grow unbounded and lead to performance issues.

When used responsibly, this enables patterns like:

[//]: # (@formatter:off)
```java
// Rerender or update every Project referencing a shared Tag
for(Map.Entry<String, Class<?>> entry : FluxCapacitor.get()
                .aggregateRepository().getAggregatesFor(tagId).entrySet()) {
        FluxCapacitor.loadAggregate(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue())
        .apply(new RefreshTag(tagId));
}
```
[//]: # (@formatter:on)

This approach can help keep derived or denormalized data consistent across aggregates.

---

#### `loadAggregateFor(entityId)`

Use this method to retrieve the **aggregate root** that currently contains the specified entity ID.

```java
Entity<MyAggregate> aggregate = FluxCapacitor
        .loadAggregateFor("some-entity-id");
```

Behavior:

- If the ID matches a **child entity**, the enclosing aggregate is returned.
- If the ID refers to an **aggregate root**, that root is returned directly.
- If no aggregate exists, an **empty aggregate** of type `Object` is returned. This enables bootstrapping a new one by
  applying events.

> Use `loadAggregateFor(entityId, Class<T>)` when you need type safety or to avoid relying on inference.

### Alternative Entity Identifiers

Flux Capacitor supports alternative ways to reference an entity using the `@Alias` annotation. This is especially useful
when:

- The entity needs to be looked up using a secondary identifier (e.g. an email address or external ID)
- An entity wants to reference another entity without identifier collisions

#### Lookup via Aliases

Aliases are used when:

- Loading an aggregate or entity using `FluxCapacitor.loadAggregateFor(alias)` or `FluxCapacitor.loadEntity(alias)`.
- Calling `Entity#getEntity(Object id)` on a parent entity.

> If multiple entities share the same alias, behavior is undefined‚Äîavoid alias collisions unless intentional.

#### Supported Targets

You can place `@Alias` on:

- **Fields** (e.g., `@Alias String externalId`)
- **Property methods** (e.g., `@Alias String legacyId()`)

If the property is a **collection**, all non-null elements are treated as aliases. If the value is `null` or an empty
collection, it is ignored.

#### Prefix and Postfix

To avoid clashes between IDs in different domains, use the optional `prefix` and `postfix` parameters:

```java

@Alias(prefix = "email:")
String email;

@Alias(postfix = "@external")
String externalId;
```

This ensures that `email@example.com` is stored as `email:email@example.com`, and `12345` becomes `12345@external`.

#### Example

```java

public record UserAccount(@EntityId String userId,
                          @Alias(prefix = "email:") String emailAddress) {

    @Alias
    List<String> oldIds;
}
```

Now the `UserAccount` entity can be looked up using:

```java
Entity<UserAccount> entity = FluxCapacitor
        .loadEntity("email:foo@example.com");
```

or

```java
Entity<UserAccount> entity = FluxCapacitor
        .loadEntity("1234"); // one of the oldIds
```

### üí° Tip: Use `@Alias` on Strongly-Typed `Id<T>` Identifiers

While `@Alias` can be applied to any field or property, it's often more convenient and robust to use it on a
strongly-typed identifier that extends `Id<T>`:

- `Id<T>` supports prefixing, case-insensitive matching, and type-safe deserialization.
- The `@Alias` annotation recognizes the repository ID computed by the `Id<T>` implementation.
- You don‚Äôt need to repeat the prefix in `@Alias`‚Äîit's already encoded in the `Id`.

```java
public class Email extends Id<UserAccount> {
    public Email(String email) {
        super(email, "email:");
    }
}

@Alias
Email email;
```

This allows you to load the entity by its alias:

```java
Entity<UserAccount> account = FluxCapacitor
        .loadEntity(new Email("john@example.com"));
```

This makes aliasing more explicit and reusable‚Äîparticularly useful in larger applications.

### Routing Behavior

Flux automatically routes child-targeted updates like `AuthorizeUser` and `RevokeAuthorization` to the correct nested
entity using the `@EntityId`. You don‚Äôt need to write custom matching logic ‚Äî the routing works transparently as long
as:

- The root aggregate is loaded (e.g. using `loadAggregate(userId)`), and
- The update contains enough identifying information to locate the nested entity

### Summary

This model leads to extremely clean domain logic:

- No need to manipulate collections in the aggregate
- No need for boilerplate logic to find, update, or remove children
- Nested updates stay localized to the child entity itself
