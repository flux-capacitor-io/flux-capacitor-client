/**
 * Gateway for sending outbound web requests via Flux Capacitorâ€™s proxy mechanism.
 * <p>
 * This gateway does not directly execute the request. Instead, it logs the request as a {@link WebRequest} message,
 * which is then picked up by the Flux platform's proxy. The proxy only executes the request if the request URL is
 * <strong>absolute</strong> (e.g., starts with {@code http://} or {@code https://}).
 * <p>
 * <strong>Benefits of this approach include:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> All outbound web traffic is traceable through Flux message logs.</li>
 *     <li><strong>Centralization:</strong> Outgoing requests are routed via a centralized proxy, simplifying firewalling and monitoring.</li>
 *     <li><strong>Proxy-level enhancements:</strong> The proxy can apply retries, circuit breakers, filtering, and other behaviors.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This gateway also supports local request handlers, meaning that annotated methods (e.g., {@code @HandleWebRequest}) can respond to requests directly
 * within the application if desired.
 *
