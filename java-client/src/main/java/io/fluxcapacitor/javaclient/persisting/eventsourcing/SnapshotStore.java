/**
 * Interface for managing snapshots of aggregates in an event-sourced system.
 *
 * <p>Snapshots are serialized representations of an aggregate's state at a certain point in time (i.e., after a certain
 * sequence number). They allow the system to avoid replaying the entire event history for aggregates with large event logs.
 *
 * <p>This interface defines methods for storing, loading, and deleting such snapshots. Snapshots are typically
 * used in combination with {@link io.fluxcapacitor.javaclient.persisting.repository.AggregateRepository} and
 * {@link io.fluxcapacitor.javaclient.persisting.eventsourcing.EventStore} to optimize aggregate loading.
 *
 * <p>Usage of this interface is optionalâ€”if no snapshot is found, the aggregate is reconstructed from its full event history.
