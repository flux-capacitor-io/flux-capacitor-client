/**
 * A {@link SnapshotTrigger} that triggers snapshot creation at fixed intervals based on the aggregate's sequence number.
 *
 * <p>This is the default strategy used when a snapshot period is specified, e.g., via
 * {@code @Aggregate(snapshotPeriod = 100)}. It ensures that a snapshot is created every {@code period} events.
 *
 * <p>For example, if the period is 100:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A snapshot is created after event 100 (sequence number 99)</li>
 *   <li>Then again after event 200, 300, and so on.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This is a useful strategy for reducing the number of events that need to be replayed when rehydrating
 * an aggregate, improving performance over time without incurring snapshot overhead after every event.
