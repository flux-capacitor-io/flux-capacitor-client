/**
 * A no-op implementation of the {@link FlowRegulator} interface that never requests a pause.
 * <p>
 * This regulator allows the consumer to fetch and consume messages without any delay or throttling. It is the default
 * regulator used in most cases, where message flow is unbounded or externally managed (e.g. through batch sizes, thread
 * limits, or backpressure at other levels).
 *
 * <p><strong>Behavior:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #pauseDuration()} always returns {@link java.util.Optional#empty()}, indicating the consumer should never pause.</li>
 *   <li>Ideal for high-throughput scenarios where flow regulation is unnecessary or handled outside the Flux Capacitor runtime.</li>
 *   <li>Thread-safe and stateless â€” a single shared instance is used throughout the application.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * This is the default unless overridden in {@link io.fluxcapacitor.javaclient.tracking.Consumer} or
 * {@link io.fluxcapacitor.javaclient.tracking.ConsumerConfiguration}.
 *
 * @see FlowRegulator
