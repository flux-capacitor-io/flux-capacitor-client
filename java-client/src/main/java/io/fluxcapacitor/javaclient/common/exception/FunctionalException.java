/**
 * Base class for user-facing exceptions that are intended to be serialized and transferred across system boundaries
 * (e.g., back to a calling client or frontend application).
 * <p>
 * Unlike typical internal exceptions, {@code FunctionalException}s represent errors that are meaningful to the
 * originator of a request â€” such as validation issues, authentication failures, or rejected commands.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * These exceptions are explicitly allowed to travel via Flux Platform and may appear in the result of a failed
 * command or query.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support clean serialization and prevent internal leakage, stack traces and suppressed exceptions are excluded.
