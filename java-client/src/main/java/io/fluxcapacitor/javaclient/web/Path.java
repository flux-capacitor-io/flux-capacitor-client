/**
 * Declares a path prefix that contributes to the final URI of a web handler.
 * <p>
 * The {@code @Path} annotation can be placed on packages, classes, methods, and properties (fields or getters).
 * Path values from outer levels (e.g. packages or enclosing classes) are chained with inner levels unless a path starts
 * with {@code /}, in which case the chain is reset and the path is treated as absolute.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a {@code @Path} value is empty, the system will fall back to using the simple name of the latest package,
 * (e.g. {@code com.example.users} â†’ {@code users}).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When {@code @Path} is placed on a property (field or getter), its value is used dynamically at runtime
 * to determine the path segment. In that case, the annotation is expected to be used without an explicit value.
 * The runtime property value will follow the same chaining rules: if it starts with a slash, it resets the path.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Path
 * package com.example.api;
 *
 * @Path("users")
 * public class UserController {
 *     @HandleGet("/{id}")
 *     WebResponse getUser(@PathParam String id) { ... }
 * }
 *
 * // Resolves to: /api/users/{id}
 * }</pre>
