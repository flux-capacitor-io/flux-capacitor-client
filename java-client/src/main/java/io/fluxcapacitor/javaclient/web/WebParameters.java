/**
 * Internal configuration holder used to expand the URI and method mappings of a web request handler method.
 * <p>
 * This class supports handlers that match multiple URI patterns and/or HTTP methods. It is typically used in
 * conjunction with the {@code @HandleWeb} annotation, where a single method can be annotated with multiple
 * {@link WebParameters} to define various acceptable request routes.
 *
 * <p>Each {@code WebParameters} instance includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A list of URI patterns (e.g. {@code /users}, {@code /users/{id}})</li>
 *     <li>A list of HTTP methods (e.g. {@code GET}, {@code POST})</li>
 *     <li>An optional {@code disabled} flag that disables this set of patterns</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getWebPatterns()} method expands this configuration into a {@link Stream} of
 * {@link WebPattern} instancesâ€”one for each combination of method and URI pattern.
 *
 * @see WebPattern
 * @see WebUtils#getWebPatterns(Executable)
